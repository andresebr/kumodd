        * googleapiclient librariy handles retries, so we don't need a loop for
        IncompleteReqest exception. Use '-log DEBUG' to view the repeated requests.
        use 'log_to_stdout: True' in config.yml to view them on stadnard output.

        * Google Drive folders can hold duplicate file names that are differentiated by
        their version number.  In order to save them as uniqe files on Unix and Windows
        file systems we append (version) to the filename.
        For example: ./My Drive/Untitled document(12).pdf

        Versions are not revisions. Each version can have multiple revisions.  
        
        * Verify the message digest of the metadata.  Certain keys are not reproducible.
        In other words, for a given file that has not changed, the API will return
        differing values of the key over time.  This inclues any keys that contain the
        words: Link, Match, status, Url, yaml.

        If we exclude those keys, we can digest the metadata retrieved at various times
        and compare the digest to validate whether changes have occurred.
        Conversely, if the digest of the metadata on disk is the same as the digest of
        the metadata in Google Drive, then then there have been no changes in the data.
        If revisions had occrred, the revsisions tag would have changed.

        So, for native Google Apps documents, we could use the digest of the metadata to
        detect whether we need to download an updated document.

        The MD5 of the metadata on disk can be verified using:
        
        sudo -Hi python -m pip install yq
        yq -y '.|with_entries(select(.key|test("(Link|Match|status|Url|yaml)")|not))'
